MIT 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge Log File Viewer
==============================================


REQUIREMENTS
============
    OpenGL, GLU, GLUT
    GTK+ >= 2.12
    zlib
    libjpeg
    Python >= 2.3
    Java 2 SE >= 1.5
    gcc
    make
    Apache Ant
    LCM >= 0.0.2  with Python and Java bindings installed
                  (http://lcm.googlecode.com) 

    This software was developed on Ubuntu 7.04 and Fedora Core 7

    For Debian/Ubuntu, the following packages should be sufficient:
        libgtk2.0-dev python-dev sun-java5-jdk gcc make mesa-common-dev 
        freeglut3-dev libc6-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev ant
 
INSTRUCTIONS
============

Running the 'make' command should build all components of the system.  Three
executables should be placed in the 'bin' directory:

bin/viewer            -- primary data visualization tool

bin/procman_sheriff   -- process management tool

bin/mitdgc-lcspy      -- wrapper around lcm-spy that adds compiled lcmtypes to
                         the Java classpath, so that lcm-spy can automatically
                         decode and display messages.

bin/ppms2mpeg4        -- tool for converting video clips produced by the viewer
                         into MPEG-4 video files.  Requires ffmpeg


To view a log file (distributed separately), use the lcm-logplayer-gui command
(distributed with lcm)

    $ lcm-logplayer-gui <logfile>

Then, in a separate terminal, run the viewer

    $ bin/viewer


A sample log file should be available at:  
    http://grandchallenge.mit.edu/public/mitdgc-log-sample

A listing of all publicly available log files can be found at:
    http://grandchallenge.mit.edu/public

NOTES
=====

bin/viewer is capable of recording video clips.  Select the desired frame rate
and click the "Record" button.  Files will be saved to the current directory,
with the extension ".ppms.gz"  Recorded clips consist of a list of PPM files
one after another, all in the same file, and gzipped (hence the name ppms.gz)

To convert a viewer-recorded clip to a standard video format, use ffmpeg, 
the bin/ppms2mpeg4 script, or a variant thereof.
